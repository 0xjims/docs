# Connect with your NFT

Your Tokenbound account is a smart contract wallet that's paired with your NFT, giving it the ability to do anything a wallet can. That means you can use your NFT to connect to websites and DApps using WalletConnect and perform actions on behalf of your NFT.

Here's a quick guide on how to do it.

  **Note:** WalletConnect support differs from site to site and some wallet
  actions do not have universal support, so your experience may vary.
</Callout>

On the site you want to connect to, open the connect wallet tool and tap
WalletConnect. Then copy the WC connection details using the blue copy button
on the top right:

  src="/walletconnect/connect-wallet-modal.png"
  width="720"
  height="1416"
  alt="Connect Wallet"
  className="image-center"
/>

On your NFT's page on **tokenbound.org**, click `Connect with NFT`:

<Image
  src="/walletconnect/connect-button.png"
  width="470"
  height="156"
  alt="Connect Button"
  className="image-center"
/>

The **Log in as your NFT** modal should appear, and the connection code should be pre-populated in the field. Paste the code you copied, if needed, then click Connect:

<Image
  src="/walletconnect/login-modal.png"
  width="1028"
  height="1148"
  alt="Login Modal"
  className="image-center"

/>

Your wallet should open and prompt you to sign a message to log in:

<Image
  src="/walletconnect/signature.png"
  width="944"
  height="1464"
  alt="Signature"
  className="image-center"

/>

Success! Now you can interact with DApps as your NFT. Any assets added to your NFT's Tokenbound account will be shown on its page on **tokenbound.org**
